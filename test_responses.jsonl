{"prompt": "What is machine learning?", "response": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed for every task."}
{"prompt": "Explain neural networks.", "response": "Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information through weighted connections."}
{"prompt": "What is deep learning?", "response": "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers (deep networks) to model and understand complex patterns in data."}
